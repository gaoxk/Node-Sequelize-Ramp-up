# Node-Sequelize-Ramp-up
Learning node.js and sequelizejs!
The basic node.js refresh is in script.js and file.js. I just messed around with examples and tutorials from w3schools.
I'm following this tutorial for sequelizejs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W_dd3uA1Iw
All my steps are documented to help any new members catch up quickly and help refresh any older members too! :)
